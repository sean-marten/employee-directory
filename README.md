# Employee Directory
## Description
This repository contains a proof of concept for an employee directory organizer. Currently it uses an API to display information for random users. This is rendered on the page with a react app. You are able to sort any column by clicking on the header and you can filter the users by first name through entering a filter value in the search box. The use case of this would be for easy management and quickly accessing information as a manager of employees.
